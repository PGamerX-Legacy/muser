### &#8627; Important Announcement
Hello there, Black Sheep is a multifunctional Bot as we all know , so it's obvious that it does so many tasks together. Recently it has grown at a higher speed than usual due to more people downloading discord and using it. That is why This Bot cannot provide lag-free music because of high ram usage.
So Music will be removed from the bot

But ! We have developed a **brand new music only bot** with over **20+ filters** and **30+ music commands**. It will provide you **lag-free music** as it's a **fully dedicated** music only bot
If you were using Black Sheep for music only , then it's important that you **replace it with Muser**
It was a really tough decision but I think it's the best for all of us
